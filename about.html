          <h2>The existential Campbell</h2>
            <h3>Who I am?</h3>
              <p>I'm a learner, trying to be a sponge. I am taking everything I can learn from Dev Bootcamp. I'm enjoying the ability to be a beginner again, reaching back to the days when I thought anything was possible. I get to be in that place again now. </p>
            <h3>Who I've been?</h3>
              <p>I've done a little of everything. I'm a dabbler and tinkerer by nature. I've made movies, moved furniture, built tables, built databases, created budgets, blown budgets, blown up sheds, bartended, bottled whiskey, drank whiskey, photographed drunk people, photographed sober people, driven people home, fixed peoples homes, found pets homes, painted homes, painted scenery, chewed the scenery, hiked across the scenery, interviewed hikers, met with bikers, fixed motorcycles, broke motorcycles, broke some rules, served breakfast, served the client, ran a company and quit the company. Oh, I was also a clown for a while.
            <h3>Who I could be?</h3>
              <p>I'm interested in how tech, spirituality, and aesthetics can meet. If I can make stuff that fits into that Venn Diagram, I'll be the happiest little code monkey.</p>
