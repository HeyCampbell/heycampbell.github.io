        <h5>Conflict makes my life go round<br>
            11/29/14</h5>
       <p>We've all had those moments. That moment when you're faced with some one or something that is diametrically opposed to you. My friend, you've just found a conflict. What you do next is the kind of stuff that defines a person.</p>
       <p>I'm going to do something that I'm not supposed to do: talk about my marriage. Don't worry, I'm not going to go into a TMI level of detail. I've been married for a while now, over a decade. My wife and I are creatives, we are stubborn, we don't have children. This means we've dealt with conflict. Each of us has instigated the conflicts at times, each of us have been blindsided by conflict. But, being that we are still very happy, we must have figured out a few things about conflict.</p>
       <p>There are a few different levels of conflict you'll come across. There's the little stuff, not doing dishes, leaving your pants on the floor next to the hamper. These are conflicts that in the long run don't really matter. Many of these will always be there, because in and of themselves, they are tiny. They should mean nothing. So these are the ones to dig your heels into and just be stubborn if you want. Get ready for a fight. Some people live for these fights, it can be exciting. And the stakes are low. Especially in my case, where there is so much more to our relationship than whether she's left a yogurt cup in the sink again. In my world, you can lean into these conflicts. They pass, you move on with your day.</p>
       <p>Then there are what I call next level conflicts. These are things that you really want your way, you know there will be conflict in doing so, and that conflict seems worth it. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. For instance, I spent the better part of a decade wanting to get a motorcycle. I wanted the freedom, the excitement, the ability to cruise through beautiful landscape. She of Queenly Stature was having none of it. It was too expensive and too dangerous. Her Grandfather died on a bike, her dad almost died on one. She did not have a favorable opinion. But it was something I wanted, and I thought, and I dreamed. after 8 years of me talking about it, she indulged me and bought me a rider training course, hoping it would get it out of my system. Unfortunately for her, I was hooked. It strengthened my need. I had a good year the year before, so a decent sized tax return was on it's way to me. I went and bought a busted up old bike, knowing the storm I was about to create. She was livid, but understood my conviction. We got through the conflict by doing what we could to alleviate the others needs. I always wear full armored gear when I ride, and ride like everyone else on the road is trying to kill me. I bought her a helmet and jacket, hoping she would eventually come around. 3 months passed. The $800 I had spent on her gear was just sitting in the closet. She finally asked me to take her on a ride. "Just around the neighborhood." We got about 3 blocks away before she told me to take her out of town. So we rode for 3 hours, up into the woods of Bear Mountain. She was hooked. Now I can't go anywhere without her wanting to take the bike.</p>
       <p>The moral of this story is that we had a conflict, we did what we could to resolve it together, and it was ok that we weren't exactly on the same page. There was still dissonance there, for years this went on. When we did finally come together, we both had a better understanding of what this conflict meant to us. We had a better understanding of each other.</p>
       <p>Sometimes it's worth it to avoid a conflict. The stakes may be low enough that it doesn't matter. But when something is important to you, and I mean more so than just because you want to apease your ego, it can be worth the conflict. If you stand down entirely, you may find yourself resenting the other person. Or feeling shame because you didn't fight for yourself. Or maybe through fear you've lashed out and attacked the person. Fight for the conflict. The conflict is what drives us all forward. Just make sure you fight the conflict, and not the person.</p>
       <p>Even if they are an asshole and attacking you personally. That just means they are a jerk. You can't fix a jerk. You can only affect how you handle things. Be better than them. </p>
