        <h5>On why I now want a burrito<br>
            10/18/14</h5>
       <p> <span> This week, here at DBC we started working through some HTML and CSS. And now I'm a master at it. Go ahead, ask me anything. You'll just need to give me a minute and ignore me while I Google that for you.</span>
        <span>
          Ok, so Google is.. down. Inexplicably. There is no more Google. No other resources out there. So you're stuck with me. And what I know, which is just enough to get us killed.
        </span>
        <span> I'm going to jump around a little and help you out with the things that just didn't click with me at first. And what it was that first made sense.</span>
        <h3>Wait, is that the Margin or the Padding?</h3>
        <p><span>If you're having a hard time remebering which is which, I got you. It's a burrito. The text is the chicken, right at the center. The Padding is the rice, guac, and beans. The more padding you have, the further away from your main element the border is. You see, the Border is your tortilla. It can be thick or thin. And you could forgo the bordr and just make it a bowl. Thats ok, nobody's judging. The Margins, well you can't see them. Thats that delicious burrito scent.</span>

        <h3>Building your burrito</h3>
        <p><span>First thing you got to do is get some chicken. Something like this is as good a place as any to start.</span>
          <img src="../imgs/plaincss.png">
          <span>Now if we just wrapped that up in a tortilla now, it's edible, but not as tasty as we can make it. Let's put a little padding in there to make room for some tasty guac.
          </span>
          <img src="../imgs/wrapped.png">
          <span>Ok man, this is looking tasty, but I want to wrap this burrito up good so I can eat it. Lets' play around with some border radius options.
          </span>
          <img src="../imgs/curved.png">
          <span>Better, But I just can't smell it yet. It's got to have some space to do that. Margins, move out!</span>
          <img src="../imgs/wrappedpadded.png">
          <span>Now we've got us a sweet little burrito, making this whole kitchen smell great. And I'm going to go ahead and hit up Seamless. Don't know why, but I suddenly want to put in an order from Lolitas Mexican Kitchen. They have this great Mole smothered wet buritto, it's like going to heaven. Almost as heavenly as understanding Spacing elements in CSS!</span>
