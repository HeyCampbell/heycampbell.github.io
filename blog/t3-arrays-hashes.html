       <p>Data. Data is what brings us together today.
        If you look deep enough at any code, you're going to come down to data. It's the molecules of what we build. I can create a method to manipulate anything, but without the data, what does it actually do? We're in the territory of trees falling in the forest. But give that method a little information, and you can do anything.

        Easy enough to feed one little piece of information into a program. You could just hard code that into the method. two pieces? ok, now we are getting into variables, but pretty simple. Hundreds of pieces? You better come up with a way to organize it. These data pieces have relationships with each other, order, you need to be able to search it quickly, pull from different places. You are in a world of hurt if you try to put all these into distinct variables.

        But that, my friends, is why i'm talking bout hashes today. Hashes are a way that you can maintain multiple data values inside one object, and keep them accessible at all times for your methods.

        Hashes function with a <code> key </code> and a <code>value</code>. The key points us towards the piece of data. In an array, the index number points us to the discrete data value. A hash functions similarly, with the key pointing us toward the data value. However, in a hash, the data is not accessed through an integer index, but a key which could be any object in Ruby. And in Ruby, everything is an object.

        Hashes and arrays are very similar, the main difference being the way they are ordered. Arrays are sequentially ordered, like a file cabinet, where as a hash is more like my desk, a series of piles that I totally can find anything I need. The piles aren't in any specific order on the desk.

        So Hashes Or Arrays? Why not both!

        With these data structures, you can embed the hashes inside arrays or have a hash of arrays. Be careful though, you may end up creating a black hole which would cause the universe to implode.

        Keep following along at home while I learn more about how I can use each of these to make more cool stuff. I've got a couple projects already in mind!
