        <h5>What exactly is it worth to you<br>
            11/23/14</h5>
       <p>Nothing has an intrinsic value. It's all perception, about what the evaluater feels about an object. Think about POGs. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it means you aren't worried about the stereotype threat of being too old. This was a game that soared in popularity in the early 90s. It involves small round cardboard discs and knocking them over, not unlike marbles For most of us, these don't have any value. They are pieces of cardboard with better toys printed on them. But if you were an 11 year old in the early 90s, you'd be willing to spend all of your allowance trading and buying rare POGs. It got insane, with some going for multiple hundreds of dollars. But to me, they never held value. </p>
       <p>This sort of thing holds true across pretty much all personal values. I know a guy who would pay you top dollar for vintage broadway sheet music. To me it means nothing, but he could make a large profit off of me if he sold me a sweet vintage leatehr jacket. We all have things that are worth more to us than others.</p>
       <p>For instance, I've been working for a decade in a career path some people dream of. I make commercials and movies. When I work, I'm surrounded by beautiful actresses, celebrities, interesting artists, visual storytellers. I get to travel to some really great places and have had access to some amazing locations. And I get paid pretty well to do it. But the value of this position has fallen for me in recent years. There are many aspects I never enjoyed and some that I enjoy less and less with each job.
        <p>I find my spirituality, tranquility, adventure, being present, and creativity to be the most valuable things in my life right now. I'm speaking for right now, tomorrow I may wake up and everything is different. But tonight, while I write this, I need to pursue things that fullfill these values.</p>
        <p>Let's take creativity. I don't think of this as just making pretty pictures and telling cool stories. I think problem solving and conceptualizing are hugely creative endeavors. I find myself wanting to be more and nmore present in every aspect of my life. To me, creating video products inherently puts you outside the moment. You view a performance that may have occured months to years ago, you are essentially living in the past. When you are selling people these stories, you are convincing them to live in the past as well.</p>
        <p>This, combined with the feeling that I was telling people there was something wrong with them in order to ell them things, has driven me away from video advertising. it was pushing up against my values and I spent a few years trying to make it work. Finally, I broke. I started searching everywhere for my next step. I tried a few things, distilling whiskey, running my own production company, being an artisan. Then I found working on code has been the best combination of rewarding my creativity and something I'm really interested in.</p>
        <p>Thats how my values brought me here. They were unfulfilled. Empty. But I searched and found the difference between my values and the values of those around me. And thats why I'm here. To find the space between and make something cool.</p>
