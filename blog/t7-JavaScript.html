        <h5>Why on earth would a semicolon go there?<br>
            11/23/14</h5>
       <p>Sometimes yo find yourself riding along in a car. It's a new car, or at least new to you. Maybe you've never really driven before. And you're getting pretty comfortable at highway speeds. You know how to set the AC, you got your favorite music station going, the weathers great. You've still got a long way to go, but you think you have an idea how to get there.</p>

       <p>Then you look back at the road and it's not quite the same. It's familiar, but it's different. You try to turn the car around a mountainy curve. But the car just stops working. You don't know how to ask the car what happened, but apparantly it has something to do with the semicolon in your steering wheel. Or is it that you should put one there? Regardless, you're actually on a horse, so the steering wheel does nothing.</p>
       <p>This was my experience this week with Javascript. We've been learning Ruby for several weeks here at DBC. This week we switched to Javascript and my mind went numb for a day or two. I just couldn't figure the JS syntax out. Semicolons in strange places, sometimes you don't need one, I just don't get it.</p>
       <p>But, one thing that did finally fit, was when I started picking up on Javascript Objects. I was able to get them pretty easily, they are simply a thing with a bunch of properties. It made total sense. Then I realized they were kind of like Ruby Hashes, which I've always been a little weary of. And it all came together. I was suddenly able to understand  the way hashes worked and how I could interact with them. </p>
       <p>Mission accomplished, DBC. You made me get super excited about learning something and connecting concepts across languages. Well done. </p>
