        <h5>Development as a team sport<br>
            11/5/14</h5>
       <p>Some people ahve the image in their mind of the programming genius sitting alone innhis basement, pimply faced, overwieght, and hacking away at some mainframe. Crazy symbols flashing across the screen while he drinks some unnamed energy drink that was banned in russia for being too extreme. He's on hour 36 and just about to crack the FBI security codes protecting the High school grades server. </p>
       <p>That dude exists. I know that dude. At one point in highschool I thought I was that dude. Then I realized it was the 90s and my school wasn't that advanced. My report card had handwritten grades until senior year.</p>
       <p>But that guy is no longer the face of tech development. Now companies are trying to build teams with as much diversity as possible, pulling from people with many different types of backgrounds. This biodiversity's advantages are most apparant when you look at peer pairing. Peer pairing is when you have 2 people working on the same code at the same time. One person would be the "driver," actually typing the code, while the other "naviagtes," giving direction for the code. This sort of nack and forth can yield 1.5 times the efficiency of 2 people working seperately. </p>
       <p>At DBC, we've been peer pairing every week, working with others either in person or over video chat. At this point, I've paired about 8 times, a few online, several in person, and once with 3 people! I've had some sessions that went really well and a few that were extremely frustrating. I have a habit of dominating a conversation and workflow, whether right or wrong. In an effort to make sure we are all learning our own way, I try to pull myself back when I catch myself answering all the questions. This means there are times when I think I have a method that will work, but I'm trying to make space for my pair to find a method. And a couple of times I've paired with people who think very quietly. Otherwise, I would just write all the code myself and be that pimply faced basement guy, which i don't want to be. But when my partners are on the same level or better than me, I have great sessions with more back and forth. I feel like I walk out of those much stronger, whereas the ones that I'm more dominant I feel like I'm more pedantic and frustrated. I'm trying to figure out how I can find a better balance on those.</p>
       <p>We've been pretty free to learn these experiences and techniques on our own, but we were given guidance on how to interact best. We also recieve feedback from our peers for each experience. I think there is something broken in me. I've recieved overwhelmingly positive feedback, recieveing highest marks most of the time. I have a hard time not looking at that and saying "Man, they are really liberal with this stuff." When I give feedback, I am very critical in regards to the best scores. I reserve them for the BEST of any situation. So my feedback for the same seesion may look lower than the other guys, even though we had a great session. Thats probably some messed up daddy didn't love me enough stuff.</p>

      <p>Overall, I think the pairing process that we've been using is great. It makes us accountable to someone else when right now we are doing a lot of learning on our own. And I know the goal of DBC is to get us into employable developer shape. Pairing is used in most production level companies at this point, so having these soft skills will be almost as important as the ruby skills we're building. </p>

      <p> Now if you'll excuse me, I have to hop on a crosstown bus to meet my pair for this weeks challeng 4.</p>
