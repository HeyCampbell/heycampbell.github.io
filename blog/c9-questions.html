        <h5>There is such thing as a dumb question<br>
            12/6/14</h5>
       <p>Right now, I get to ask questions. I get to ask all the questions I want. Thats part of being a student.</p>
       <p>But for a large part of my adult life, I've been afraid to ask. You see, I've been working ion the film and commercial advertising realm for a decade. When I first started, I rose very quickly through the ranks. i got hired as a PA on a tv show, knowing nothing. In 2 weeks I was promoted to coordinator. Suddenly, I had to at least pretend like I knew what a coordinator did. I made it through, did a pretty good job, and soon found myself getting hired for jobs that I had no clue how to do. And I was afraid to ask questions about how to do these jobs, because then I'd reveal my ignorance and my entire career would collapse. Of course, I now know better, but thats what I felt. I even had a mentor tell me that. </p>
       <p>So when I inevitably hit a ceiling, I could not get past it. I had spent 8 years just trying to stay afloat and ahead of the curve. I had not cultivated a growth mindset. I watched friends who used to be jealous of my ability to get by doing anything rise up in the industry, working well beyond the kind of jobs I was able to pull off on sheer moxie. And it became disheartening. I started to resent my friends. And I couldn't ask the guy I had brought into the industry how he had gotten so far ahead of me. I was embarrassed. And in a way, it broke my heart. I felt trapped. And in an industry changing as quickly as visual stroytelling has changed in the last decade, stagnant is death. I lost all interest in what I was working on. There are several reasons behind that and if you want to hear my diatribe on the work, it will cost you a couple of whiskeys.
      <p>Now, though, I can ask all those questions. Without fear. It's glorious. I can ask stupid questions, smart questions, irrelevant questions, whatever. I can ask questions that are just tangentially related. And the best part about asking questions online is that you can see that there are hundreds of people who have asked your exact question on Stack Overflow or Quora. So you know it's not just you being stupid!</p>
      <p>I have asked a few questions here and there that I didn't get a response to. When this happens, it actually answers my question. It causes me to look at my question and figure out if there is a better way to phrase it. I essentially refactor it. And in doing so, I usually find some answers. It's the same when I am asked a question I don't understand. I have to frame the question in  away I can understand it. i frame it in a way I would ask it, figure out the answer, then try to figure out how the question was framed in the first place.</p>
      <p>The only way you can truly ask a wrong question is by not asking one. I'm a bit talmudic by nature, everything should be questioned. If I have a belief that cannot stand up to questions, I should not have that belief</p>
      <p>So I ask you. What do you want to do next?</p>
