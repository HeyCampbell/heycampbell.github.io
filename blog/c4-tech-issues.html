       <p>Perhaps you've been living under a rock. Perhaps you just haven't been paying attention to the Nerdosphere. But there is some serious shit going on right now that we need to take a look at. People are calling it<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy"> GamerGate </a> this time. It involves a female game developer who, after her ex boyfriend blogged about a possible journalistic conflict of interest concerning her romantic involvement with then partner, began to recieve ongoing harrassment, including threats of violence and outright death threats.</p>
       <p>This circle of cowardice expanded as several journalists and other female developers came out in support of her. These women were doxxed as well, with their addresses published online leading them to flee their homes for fear of what might happen. To make this all even more disgusting, there have been several men who have spoken out against these actions. Yet they do not receive the hatred and violence that these women do.</p>
       <p>This also comes at the same time <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A"> as this video.</a> While this is not really connected to the tech world, it exhibits the same privilege that some men feel they can exert over a woman. It's uninvited, often threatening, and offers zero consequence for the speaker while deeply affecting the person being spoken to.</p>

       <p>This is not a "tech" issue. This is not a "Femminist" issue. This is an issue of being human.</p>
       <p>I know I come from a place of priveledge. I am a male. I am white. I live within my means and make enough money that I can do most of the things I want to do. As Louie CK says, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87LGmm1M5Is">you can't say anything to hurt me.</a> So I will always be on the outside of this issue, on some level. I will likely never have this particular hate speech pointed at me. <p>But, on the other hand, I fit into the exact demo of the type of person saying these things online. The only difference between me and the people advocating death threats over game development is that I'm not a complete shithead. Other than that, we are basically the same. There are a few things I can do to try to make this issue better.</p>
        <p>First, we need to remember that <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2014/10/06/online-misogyny-idea-that-internet-isnt-real/">THE INTERNET IS A REAL PLACE!</a> There is a pervading belief that harasment here doesn't count because it's not corporeal. I'm not about to get into a drug addled debate over what is real, man. But it it part of our experience, therefor it is real. If I would not say something to someone in person, I should not be saying it online. It's that simple. Even online, we are humans interacting. Even when we hide behind the veil of anonymity.</p>
        <p>In a more personal setting, call out sexism whenever you see it. If you have a friend who makes rape jokes, you've got to let them know it's just not cool. Even when there are no women around.</p>
        <p>Support and empower the women around you. And not just because they are women. That's condescending. Support them becasue they bring value to the team, becaseu they are good at their jobs, because they are people who desrve support. Don't make it into affirmative action, that just builds resentment. Do it because  people deserve a chance as much as anyone else.</p>
        <p>Ruby Rogues, one of my favorite dev related podcasts, just released an <a= href"http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/179-rr-accountability-and-diversity-with-meagan-waller">amazing episode featuring developer Meagan Waller.</a> The Rogues, who are themselves a very diverse group, talk about all the ways to support an increasing diversity in the dev community. Listen to it, you could learn a lot.

        <p>I grew up in a different era. Women where fighting for their place in the business world, for their ability to have their own career. They were winning, Lillith Fair was a huge music festival.Now they are fighting to not have death threats leveled against them while they do it. And we have Niki Minaj. We've come so far and in the opposite direction at the same time.
