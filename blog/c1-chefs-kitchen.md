# Welcome your fear
#### Or how I learned to fear the things I wasn't even thinking about
#### 10/10/14

I'm not ready
You're right. You aren't ready

I'm not as smart as everyone else in the class.
You're right. Everybody is smarter than you in at least one aspect. Some of them are smarter than you in every aspect.

I don't get the language yet.
No you don't. And you don't even know how much you don't know.

I'm not a quick typist.
Not only that, but you look at the keyboard the entire time.

I don't think I can really devote the time to this right now.
Then why did you just pay yur tuition? You can't afford NOT to do it now.

I'm socially awkward, I don't know about this peer pairing thing.
You're right. I can't even keep a conversation going with you. You keep coming back to all these fears you have.

You're fears are valid. They are real. They are palpable. And there are scarier tings you havn't even realized yet. These things shouldn scare you. So be scared.

But what then?

You have a few choices. You can run away from your fears. But you're here now, so thats not what you want to do. Next option: Hide from your fears. Ok, thats basically the same as running away. Ignore them. Just ignore them. It's the easiest way to go. How is that working for you? Still have those fears? They getting bigger? Gnawing at you from the inside? So then let's face our fears and get over them. It's a big boy move, but you'll be able to get away from your fear. It's like going bungee jumping to get over a fear of hieghts. It works, it's great, you'll feel accomplished and strong.

But that's not what we are going for here.

I say, stay scared. Don't get past it, don't ignore it, don't run away. Look the wolf in the eyes, scream and cry a little, and walk right into his jaws.

And punch him square in the mouth.

It'll hurt. And you'll learn that your fear was based on something real. And next time it comes up, you'll still be scared. It's that fear that pushed you to the point you could punch a freaking wolf in the mouth.

It's when we are pushed to our limits that we grow the most. Fear is what brings us to those limits. And staying in that zone allows us to be better than we ever thought we could be.

Stay mad. Stay hungry. Stay scared.

Make Awesome.
