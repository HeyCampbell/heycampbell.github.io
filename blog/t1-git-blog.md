  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),

# DBC Unit 1 Week 1
#### Or What I've learned about development this morning
#### 10/7/14

Remember that time you had that huge paper due, the one you were working on for 6 months? It was open on your laptop when you took a nap before you submitted the final copy. Remember how you had that cat that was a total jerk? How he'd always just walk all over your keyboard? Remember how you felt when you woke up to find your report was now just 46 pages of wasdjkfhiufvblriwufkjfbiui3q3 vur erkj? And somehow, this furry little bastard had just happened to hit command s. How does that even happen?! Seriously!

I remember it. I don't remember the next 12 hrs of furious writing and looking for notes and cursing and red rage against tabbies. The mind tends to suppress traumatic memories like that.

That was the last time I only had one save state. Without realizing it, I learned all about version control that day. I only had one dataset, which got destroyed. Had you just incremented your save each day, you would have been fine. But no, you'd been working on one file for 2 months. At least we know better know.

If you take that lesson, and you should, into developing, Github makes total sense. Everytime you commit a save, it's safe. You are now free to let a cat walk all over your keyboard. Who knows, maybe he'll go all shakespearean monkey and solve that problem you've been banging your head against. In the unlikely event he doesn't, you've got the code saved in a way that people developers can fork it and try to fix it in a slightly more logical way.

And that is the true genius behind git and Github. It allows us to collaborate on code in a very organized and supported way. I can put together a basic piece of code, place it on Github, and find collaborators who can help me build the parts I can't build.

So stop letting your cat program for you. Get with git and Github before sof3fllkegiej Damnit Mr. Skittles, get off the desk!
