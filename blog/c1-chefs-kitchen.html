        <h5>On keeping your wolf wild<br>
            10/10/14</h5>


       <p> <span>I'm not ready.</span>

<span>You're right. You aren't ready.</span>

<span>I'm not as smart as everyone else in the class.</span>

<span>You're right. Everybody is smarter than you in at least one aspect. Some of them are smarter than you in every aspect.</span>

<span>I don't get the language yet.</span>

<span>No you don't. And you don't even know how much you don't know.</span>

<span>I'm not a quick typist.</span>

<span>Not only that, but you look at the keyboard the entire time.</span>

<span>I don't think I can really devote the time to this right now.</span>

<span>Then why did you just pay your tuition? You can't afford NOT to do it now.</span>

<span>I'm socially awkward, I don't know about this peer pairing thing.</span>

<span>You're right. I can't even keep a conversation going with you. You keep talking about all these fears you have.</span>

<span>You're fears are valid. They are real. They are palpable. And there are scarier things you haven't even realized yet. These things should scare you. So be scared.</span>

<span>But what then?</span>

<span>You have a few choices. You can run away from your fears. But you're here now, so thats not what you want to do. Next option: Hide from your fears. Ok, thats basically the same as running away. Ignore them. Just ignore them. It's the easiest way to go. How is that working for you? Still have those fears? They getting bigger? Gnawing at you from the inside? So then let's face our fears and get over them. It's a big boy move, but you'll be able to get away from your fear. It's like going bungee jumping to get over a fear of hieghts. It works, it's great, you'll feel accomplished and strong.</span>

<span>But that's not what we are going for here.</span>

<span>I say, stay scared. Don't get past it, don't ignore it, don't run away. Look the wolf in the eyes, let him growl and roar and snap his jaws.</span>

<span>And poke him in the eye. THEN run.</span>

<span>Make sure you pissed him off good. You want that fear chasing you. You've got to use it to make you run faster and farther than you knew you could.</span>

<span>It's when we are pushed to our limits that we grow the most. Fear is what brings us past our limits. And staying in that zone allows us to be better than we ever thought we could be.</span>

<span>Keep the wolf at your back. And when he starts to give up, let him catch up so he's right at your heels again.</span>

<span>Stay mad. Stay hungry. Stay scared.</span>

<span>Make Awesome.</span>
