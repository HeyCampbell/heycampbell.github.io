        <h5>Stereotype threat and how to not fall into that trap<br>
            11/16/14</h5>
       <p>We've all been told stories about ourselves, often by people who don't know much about us. We're told that we're not likely to succeed. Nothing to do with us, just that most people with our background have not succeeded. So we may not suceed either. There is a stereotype that we hope to not fulfill, an idea of how it might go. However, we are not a living stereotype. We work hard, we rise above, we have built a good support system. We are not descended from fearful men. <br>Yet there is still that thought in the back of my head. What if i am just another guy who is too old to get it? I'm not, though, I'm up there with everyone else, I'm in front of the pace sometimes. <br>But it could be true. <br>It's not though! <br>But what if you are? It's ok, most people slow down a little as they get older<br>I'll just have to work harder because while I was thinking about that, I've now fallen behind. Thanks, jerk brain! <br>Hey, I'm not going to say I told you so, but you're not really keeping up with the class anymore. Shoulda stayed in advertising.  </p>

        <p> That downward spiral you just got to see a little of is a manifestation of the Stereotype threat. Traditionally, it's applied to people who feel that the culture they come from has certain expectations for students. Part of your social identity says you won't be a great student, so you push back and fight hard to not be that stereotype. However, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. You spend so much time trying to not be something, you don't put enough energy into being something else.</p>

        <p>When you ride a motorcycle, one of the cardinal rules is to look where you want to go. It seems simple. But imagine you're blasting down a curvy road. You come around a corner and there, in the middle of the road, is a deer. Doing that stupid deer thing where they just stand there and stare. You don't have enough time to stop, but you've got the space to swerve. You stare at the deer, intent on not hitting it. Every bit of you is willing your bike away from this deer. Then BAM you're wearing a deer. </p>

        <p>Its estimated this is a factor in most motorcycle collisions, especially single vehicle incidents. All we have to do is look away from the danger. The bike wants to go where we point it. If you had looked to the left or right of the deer, you could ahve swerved around it. You look at the road you want to ride on.</p>

        <p>This is a pretty apt metaphor for stereotype threat to me. If all I want to do is not fulfill some prophecy, then I spend so much time trying to rewrite someone elses story I never stop to ask if this is a story I'm even in. It's not my story, but I'm spending so much energy trying to make it fit, that it starts to hurt me.</p>

        <p> Let's write our own stories. They may not be perfect. We may not even be the hero. But WE write it. Not you. Not some guy with outdated ideas that don't apply to me. We write it.</p>
