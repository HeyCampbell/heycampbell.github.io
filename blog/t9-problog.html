        <h5>But it was just so perfect before!!<br>
            12/6/14</h5>
       <p>This website was created to keep a record of my time here at DBCs phase 0. It was literally the first thing I ever made with HTML, outside of a few exercises. And I put a ton of energy into it. Probably spent about 10 hrs on it during the Week 2 asignment. And in the end I had a working, single page site.</p>
       <p>Which I hated.</p>
       <p>Luckily, we were encouraged to revisit and make some changes to the site this week. I was able to add some things that I think make the site much nicer. I have not yet integrated a framework into the site, which I would like to do at some point. I spent the time I could have been doing that learning about Rails. THIS is what I really want to integrate. Because Right now, the blogs are served up in a very outdated manner.</p>
       <p>I know we'll be picking up some Rails knowledge in the next few weeks, so once we've done that, keep tuned here for a new, updated site, complete with a Dynamic web app.</p>
       <p>Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go try to give my family some good memories of me as they will apparently not see me for while.</p>
        <p>Make Awesome</p>
